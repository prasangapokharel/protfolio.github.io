      <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8 leading-tight">The Rise of Nepal's Python Talent: A 2026 Guide for USA Startups</h1>
      
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-10">While India and Eastern Europe have traditionally dominated the outsourcing market, 2026 has seen Nepal emerge as a premier hub for Python and AI developers. For USA-based startups, this presents a unique opportunity.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-6 mt-12">1. Unmatched Work Ethic and Dedication</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Developers in Nepal, particularly in the Python and Django community, are known for their high degree of ownership. Unlike large agencies where you are just another client, a dedicated developer from Nepal like <strong>Prasanga Pokharel</strong> treats your product as their own.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-6 mt-12">2. Significant Cost Arbitrage</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">A senior developer in San Francisco costs $200k+/year. In Nepal, you can hire the same level of expertise—proficient in modern stacks like React, FastAPI, and Cloud Architecture—for a fraction of the cost. This allows startups to extend their runway while maintaining high engineering standards.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-800 mb-6 mt-12">3. English Proficiency and Communication</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">Nepal's education system places a strong emphasis on English, making communication with USA teams seamless. In 2026, where Slack and Zoom are the primary office spaces, the language barrier is non-existent, and the cultural alignment with Western business values is strong.</p>
