    <div class="prose prose-xl prose-violet mx-auto">
      <p class="text-xl text-slate-600 mb-12">By 2026, the AI hype has settled into a practical question for businesses: Should we pay OpenAI (or Anthropic) per token, or should we host our own open-source models? As a Python developer specializing in AI, here is my analysis.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. The OpenAI Convenience (and Cost)</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">For most startups in the USA, starting with OpenAI APIs is a no-brainer. It requires zero infrastructure management and provides the highest intelligence. However, as of 2026, many high-volume applications are finding the "token tax" unsustainable for their margins.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. The Rise of Private LLMs (Llama 4 & Beyond)</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">With the release of Llama 4 and Mistral's latest models in early 2026, the gap between open-source and proprietary intelligence has closed. Many Australian and USA firms with strict data privacy requirements are now choosing to host their own models on private cloud infrastructure (AWS Bedrock or Azure AI).</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Privacy and Data Sovereignty</h2>
      <p class="mb-8">In 2026, data is the new oil, and companies are reluctant to send their proprietary trade secrets to third-party APIs. Hosting a custom-tuned model in your own VPC ensures that your data never leaves your control—a critical factor for Fintech and Healthcare sectors.</p>
