    <h1 class="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-black text-gray-900 mb-8">React vs Vue: Which Frontend Pairs Best with Python in 2026?</h1>
    
    <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-700">
      <p class="mb-6 text-xl">For a full-stack Python developer, the choice of a frontend framework is as much about the API integration as it is about the UI. In 2026, React and Vue remain the two heavyweights. Let's look at how they perform when backed by Django or FastAPI.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">React: The Ecosystem Giant</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">React continues to be the most requested skill in the USA and Australian markets. Its ecosystem of libraries—like TanStack Query for data fetching from Python APIs and Next.js for SSR—makes it the "safe" choice for large-scale enterprise apps. If you want to hire a developer who can tap into a massive pool of ready-made components, React is the winner.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">Vue: The Developer's Favorite</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Vue has gained significant traction in 2026 for its "SFC" (Single File Component) architecture, which many Python developers find more intuitive than React's JSX. It offers a more streamlined integration with Django templates for hybrid applications, making it a favorite for startups that want to move fast without the complexity of a full-blown SPA.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Verdict for 2026</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Choose React if:</strong> You are targeting the USA/AU enterprise market and need to scale your team quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Vue if:</strong> You value developer happiness and need a clean, lightweight integration with your Python backend.</li>
      </ul>
