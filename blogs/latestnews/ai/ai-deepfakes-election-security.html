    The 2024 election faces a novel threat: AI-generated deepfakes. These hyper-realistic videos and audio recordings can make candidates appear to say or do things they never did, spreading misinformation at viral speeds. Security experts and AI researchers are racing to develop detection tools.
</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Technology Behind the Threat</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) allow for the creation of deepfakes that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. In a heated political climate, a well-timed deepfake could sway public opinion before it can be debunked. This poses a direct challenge to the integrity of the democratic process.
</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Verifying the Truth</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Voters must now become digital detectives. AI-powered detection software is being integrated into social platforms, but skepticism and verifying sources remain the best defense. The 2024 election will define how societies adapt to this new era of synthetic media.
