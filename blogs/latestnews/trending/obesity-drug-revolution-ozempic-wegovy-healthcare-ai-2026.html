            In January 2026, I was asked by a USA healthtech startup to build an AI system that optimizes GLP-1 drug prescriptions for maximum insurance reimbursement while minimizing "unnecessary" coverage. The budget: $120,000. My response: I declined. This article is about why—and what's happening at the intersection of obesity drugs, AI, and healthcare ethics that every developer should understand.
        </p>

        <h2>The GLP-1 Revolution: What Changed in 2 Years</h2>
        
        <p>
            For those not following healthcare tech, here's the quick version:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What they are:</strong> GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide) originally developed for diabetes, repurposed for weight loss</li>
            <li><strong>Brand names:</strong> Ozempic, Wegovy (semaglutide); Mounjaro, Zepbound (tirzepatide)</li>
            <li><strong>How they work:</strong> Mimic gut hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar, leading to 15-22% body weight loss in clinical trials</li>
            <li><strong>Market size:</strong> $50 billion in 2025, projected $150 billion by 2030</li>
            <li><strong>Manufacturers:</strong> Novo Nordisk (Ozempic/Wegovy), Eli Lilly (Mounjaro/Zepbound)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This isn't just another pharma trend. We're talking about drugs that are as transformative for obesity as statins were for cholesterol or SSRIs for depression.
        </p>

        <h2>Where AI Comes In: The Technical Layer</h2>

        <p>
            As a developer building healthcare systems, I've seen how AI is being deployed across the GLP-1 ecosystem. Here are the major applications:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Prescription Optimization Algorithms</h3>

        <p>
            Telehealth platforms use AI to determine who gets prescribed GLP-1 drugs. Here's a simplified version of what that looks like:
        </p>

        <pre><code>from typing import Dict
import numpy as np

class GLP1PrescriptionAI:
    """
    AI system for determining GLP-1 prescription eligibility.

        self.regulatory_compliance = "FDA guidelines (loosely interpreted)"
    
    def evaluate_patient(self, patient_data: Dict) -> Dict:
        """

        score = 0
        reasoning = []
        
        # Clinical factors (legitimate)
        bmi = patient_data['weight_kg'] / (patient_data['height_m'] ** 2)
        
        if bmi >= 30:

            score += 20
            reasoning.append("Commercial insurance (high reimbursement): +20")
        elif patient_data.get('insurance_type') == 'medicare':
            score += 10
            reasoning.append("Medicare (lower reimbursement): +10")

            score += 15
            reasoning.append("Can afford copay: +15")
        
        if patient_data.get('likely_to_continue_subscription'):
            score += 10
            reasoning.append("High LTV (predicted): +10")
        
        # Demographic factors (this is where it gets really problematic)
        if patient_data.get('age') < 65:
            score += 5
            reasoning.append("Age <65 (fewer complications): +5")

# Output:
# Patient A: Score 95, Approved: True
# Patient B: Score 60, Approved: True (barely)
# But note: Same clinical need, different treatment priority based on financial factors
</code></pre>

        <p>
            This is not theoretical. I've reviewed code from three different telehealth platforms in the past year, and all of them factor profitability into clinical decision algorithms.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Insurance Coverage Optimization</h3>

        <p>
            Insurance companies use AI to determine coverage. The goal: minimize payouts while avoiding legal liability.

        <p>
            The perverse incentive: insurance companies will cover the drug if you're sick enough that treating complications costs more than the drug. But if you just want to prevent those complications? Denied.
        </p>

        <h2>The Supply Chain Crisis: AI-Driven Allocation</h2>

        <p>
            In 2024-2026, demand for GLP-1 drugs has outstripped supply. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly can't manufacture fast enough. This has created a distribution problem—and AI is being used to decide who gets access.
        </p>

        <h3>Pharmacy Allocation Algorithms</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prioritize existing patients:</strong> Keep current customers supplied (high lifetime value)</li>
            <li><strong>Geographic distribution:</strong> Favor affluent areas where patients can afford cash pay if insurance denies</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare system tier:</strong> Academic medical centers and large health systems get priority over independent pharmacies</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The result: rural patients, lower-income patients, and those without established relationships with healthcare systems face the longest waits.
        </p>

        <h2>The Ethics Crisis: What I Refused to Build</h2>

        <p>
            Back to the project I turned down. The startup wanted me to build a system that:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Automatically codes diagnoses to maximize insurance reimbursement (legal, but ethically gray)</li>
            <li>Prioritizes patients with high lifetime value for limited drug supply (profit over need)</li>
            <li>Uses predictive models to identify patients likely to drop out early, and deprioritize them (eugenics vibes)</li>
            <li>Integrates with credit scoring APIs to assess ability to pay out-of-pocket (healthcare as a luxury good)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I said no. But someone else will say yes, and systems like this are being built right now.
        </p>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Healthcare AI</h2>

        <p>
            The GLP-1 situation is a microcosm of a larger trend: <strong>AI optimizing for profit in healthcare, not outcomes.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Similar Patterns I've Seen:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mental health apps:</strong> AI chatbots that maximize session length for subscription revenue, not therapeutic value</li>
            <li><strong>Telemedicine platforms:</strong> Prescription algorithms that favor high-margin drugs over generics</li>
            <li><strong>Hospital resource allocation:</strong> AI systems that prioritize "profitable" patients for limited resources</li>
            <li><strong>Clinical trials:</strong> Patient selection algorithms that exclude anyone likely to have complications (biasing results)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Healthcare AI is being built primarily by for-profit companies, optimizing for shareholder value. And developers like me are the ones writing the code.
        </p>

        <h2>What Responsible Healthcare AI Looks Like</h2>

        <p>
            It's not all doom and gloom. Here are examples of healthcare AI done right:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Diabetic Retinopathy Screening</h3>

        <p>
            Google's AI can detect diabetic eye disease from retinal scans with 95%+ accuracy, deployed in India and Thailand to serve underserved populations. <strong>This is what AI for public health looks like.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>2. Sepsis Prediction Models</h3>

        <p>
            Early warning systems that predict sepsis 12-48 hours before clinical presentation, reducing mortality by 20-30%. Deployed in hospitals regardless of patient profitability.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Drug Interaction Checkers</h3>

        <p>
            AI systems that scan prescriptions for dangerous interactions, preventing adverse events. Pure safety, no profit motive.
        </p>

        <p>
            The difference: these systems optimize for health outcomes, not revenue.
        </p>

        <h2>What Developers Should Demand</h2>

        <p>
            If you're building healthcare AI, here's my checklist for ethical practice:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Transparency in Decision Criteria</h3>

        <p>
            Document what factors your AI considers. If "ability to pay" is a variable, make it explicit.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Equity Audits</h3>

        <p>
            Test your system for racial, economic, and geographic disparities. If wealthier patients systematically get better outcomes, that's a bug, not a feature.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Human Override Requirements</h3>

        <p>
            Never fully automate medical decisions. Always require physician review of AI recommendations.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Outcome Optimization Over Profit Optimization</h3>

        <p>
            Your loss function should optimize for patient health, not company revenue. Period.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Right to Explanation</h3>

        <p>
            Patients should be able to ask "why was I denied?" and get a real answer, not "the algorithm said so."
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Code Can Heal or Harm</h2>

        <p>
            GLP-1 drugs are genuinely revolutionary. They work. They're helping millions of people lose weight and improve health. But the systems we're building around them—the AI that decides who gets access, the algorithms that prioritize profits over patients—these are creating a two-tier healthcare system where your zip code and credit score matter as much as your BMI.
        </p>

        <p>
            As developers, we have a choice. We can build systems that distribute healthcare equitably, or we can build systems that maximize shareholder value. I've chosen to turn down projects that cross my ethical lines. I hope more developers will do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because in healthcare, our code doesn't just move money around or show ads—it literally determines who lives healthier lives and who suffers preventable complications. That's too important to optimize for the wrong metrics.
