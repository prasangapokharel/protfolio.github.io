            In November 2025, I was approached by a venture-backed PropTech startup to build an AI system that optimizes rent prices in real-time across thousands of units. The pitch: "Help landlords maximize revenue by predicting exactly how much each tenant can afford to pay." The implied outcome: extract maximum rent from people who have no choice but to pay. I declined. This article is about why—and what's really happening in the intersection of housing, AI, and late-stage capitalism.
        </p>

        <h2>The Crisis by the Numbers: February 2026</h2>
        
        <p>Let's start with the data that keeps getting worse:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Median home price in USA:</strong> $412,000 (up from $240,000 in 2020)</li>
            <li><strong>Price-to-income ratio:</strong> 8.1x in major cities (historically sustainable level: 3-4x)</li>
            <li><strong>Median rent (1-bedroom, major cities):</strong> $2,100/month (up 42% since 2020)</li>
            <li><strong>Homeownership rate (Millennials age 30-35):</strong> 43% (vs. 61% for Boomers at same age)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-burdened renters (paying >30% income on rent):</strong> 52% of all renters</li>
            <li><strong>Homelessness in USA:</strong> 653,000 (up 18% since 2022)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Meanwhile, in my home country of Nepal, the median home price in Kathmandu is $180,000—which sounds cheap until you realize median household income is $4,800/year. Housing affordability is a global crisis, not just an American problem.</p>

        <h2>How AI Is Being Used in Housing: The Technical Reality</h2>

        <p>This is real. RealPage, which provides pricing software to landlords managing 13+ million units, was sued in 2023 for anticompetitive price-fixing. The lawsuit alleges their algorithm allowed landlords to collectively raise rents beyond what a competitive market would support.</p>

        <h2>Other Ways Tech Is Used (For Better and Worse)</h2>

        <h3>2. Tenant Screening Algorithms</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>The pitch:</strong> Reduce risk for landlords by predicting good tenants</li>
            <li><strong>The problem:</strong> Algorithms trained on biased data systematically discriminate against minorities, single parents, and those with past financial hardship</li>
            <li><strong>The impact:</strong> People denied housing based on opaque AI scores, no recourse to appeal</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Corporate Home-Buying Algorithms</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Companies:</strong> Invitation Homes, American Homes 4 Rent, Blackstone-backed firms</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> AI identifies undervalued homes, automated offers within hours</li>
            <li><strong>Scale:</strong> 574,000 single-family homes owned by institutional investors (2026)</li>
            <li><strong>Effect:</strong> First-time buyers outbid by algorithms with instant cash offers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Short-Term Rental Optimization (Airbnbification)</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI systems:</strong> Predict when to convert long-term rental to Airbnb for max profit</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Entire neighborhoods converted to tourist accommodations</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Barcelona lost 10,000 long-term units to Airbnb; Venice, Lisbon similar stories</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What PropTech Could Do Right (But Mostly Doesn't)</h2>

        <p>Not all housing technology is extractive. Here are examples that actually help:</p>

        <h3>Positive Use Cases:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Affordable housing lotteries:</strong> Transparent algorithms for allocating below-market units</li>
            <li><strong>Modular construction:</strong> AI-optimized prefab designs reducing costs by 20-40%</li>
            <li><strong>Energy efficiency upgrades:</strong> ML predicting best weatherization ROI, reducing tenant utility costs</li>
            <li><strong>Housing voucher matching:</strong> Algorithms helping people find landlords who accept Section 8</li>
            <li><strong>Community land trust management:</strong> Tech enabling cooperative ownership models</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The difference: these optimize for access and affordability, not profit maximization.</p>

        <h2>The Real Solutions: Policy Over PropTech</h2>

        <p>After analyzing the housing market as both a developer and someone who can't afford to buy in most USA cities despite earning six figures, I'm convinced: <strong>technology alone won't fix this.</strong></p>

        <h3>What Actually Works (Based on International Evidence):</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Massive social housing programs:</strong> Vienna: 60% of residents in public/co-op housing, affordable and high-quality</li>
            <li><strong>Vacancy taxes:</strong> Vancouver's 3% empty homes tax reduced vacancies by 25%</li>
            <li><strong>Strict rent control:</strong> Germany's rent-brake law limiting increases to 10% above local average</li>
            <li><strong>Land value tax:</strong> Singapore's model capturing land value appreciation for public benefit</li>
            <li><strong>Ban corporate landlords:</strong> Copenhagen limits for-profit ownership of residential property</li>
            <li><strong>Upzoning:</strong> Tokyo's permissive zoning keeps rents affordable despite being largest metro in world</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Notice what's NOT on this list: AI rent optimization, blockchain property records, or any other PropTech buzzwords.</p>

        <h2>What I'm Building Instead</h2>

        <h2>Conclusion: Housing Is a Human Right, Not an Investment Optimization Problem</h2>

        <p>The housing crisis isn't caused by insufficient technology. It's caused by treating homes as financial assets instead of places to live. AI rent optimization doesn't solve the problem—it accelerates it.</p>

        <p>As developers, we need to ask: <strong>What are we optimizing for?</strong> If the answer is "maximum extraction of wealth from people who need shelter," we're part of the problem.</p>

        <p>We can build technology that genuinely helps:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Tools for community land trusts and cooperative ownership</li>
            <li>Transparent allocation systems for affordable housing</li>
            <li>Energy efficiency optimizations that reduce tenant costs</li>
            <li>Construction automation that lowers building costs</li>
            <li>Housing policy simulations to predict intervention outcomes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But ultimately, we need policy change more than we need apps. We need to build millions of homes, regulate speculation, tax vacancy, and treat housing as infrastructure, not investment vehicles.</p>

        <p>Technology can support that. But it can't replace it.</p>

            This article represents my analysis as a developer and renter in an unaffordable housing market. I'm not an economist or housing policy expert, but I understand the algorithms—and I've chosen not to build systems that make the crisis worse.
