          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For decades, government cybersecurity relied on a "castle and moat" approach: secure the perimeter, and trust everything inside. In 2026, with the explosion of remote work, cloud adoption, and sophisticated nation-state cyberattacks, this model is dangerously obsolete. Enter <strong>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The core principle is simple: <strong>"Never Trust, Always Verify."</strong> No user, device, or system is trusted by default, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Why Governments Are Rushing to Zero Trust</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-4">
            <li><strong>Lateral Movement Prevention:</strong> In traditional networks, once an attacker breached the firewall, they could move freely. ZTA uses micro-segmentation to trap attackers, limiting the "blast radius" of any breach.</li>
            <li><strong>Ransomware Resilience:</strong> With strict identity verification for every file access request, ransomware struggles to spread and encrypt critical government databases.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Remote Work:</strong> Government employees can securely access classified resources from anywhere, as access depends on real-time verification of user identity and device health, not just VPN location.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-8">
          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Implementation Challenge</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Transitioning to Zero Trust is not a "flip the switch" moment; it's a multi-year journey. Governments face the challenge of modernizing legacy mainframes that were never designed for modern authentication protocols.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            However, the mandate is clear. By 2026, federal agencies failing to meet ZTA benchmarks are facing budget cuts and oversight hearings. The focus has shifted from "compliance" to "active defense."

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Future Outlook: AI-Driven Zero Trust</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The next frontier is integrating AI with Zero Trust policies. Machine learning models now analyze user behavior in real-time. If a user suddenly downloads terabytes of sensitive data at 3 AM, the system automatically revokes access—even if the password was correct. This dynamic, context-aware security is the future of national defense.
